# CellMAPS <br/>
CellMAPS (Single-**Cell** **M**odel-based **A**nalysis **P**ipeline for **S**patial-omics) is a no-code processing and analysis workflow for high-dimensional spatial biology technologies, built in CincoDeBio. CellMAPS utilises a modelling environment (implemented in the Eclipse desktop app), in which workflows are developed, and an execution environment (implemented in a kubernetes native app), where these workflows are executed on the input data. Workflow modules include de-arraying, image normalisation, cell segmentation, feature extraction, spatial expression plotting, cell clustering, and more. The workflows are customisable depending on the use case. However, dataflow restrictions only allow workflows which are theoretically possible to be executed (e.g. cell clustering can not be performed before cell segmentation, etc.). CellMAPS can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. The manuscript for CellMAPS can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/) and the manuscript for CincoDeBio can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/).

## Installation

At the moment, to use CellMAPS, both the modelling and execution environments must be downloaded and installed. We are currently working on merging the execution platform with [Cinco Cloud](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-19756-7_23) (a Kubernetes native Application) so in future versions the entire platform (modelling and execution platforms) will be combined and deployed together. <br /> <br />
Currently all the workflow modules for CellMAPS are stored on a public [docker hub](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-hub/) repository. In order to avoid rate limiting, the install will request valid a valid dockerhub account (username & password) which can be created [here](https://hub.docker.com/signup). In total, installation should take ~15 minutes to complete on a standard desktop/laptop.

### Windows 10/11

#### Prerequisites

Download and install the below:
* [Microk8s](https://microk8s.io/): The Kubernetes native application is deployed on a Microk8s cluster. Download the Windows version [here](https://microk8s.io/#install-microk8s). <br />
  - Make sure to add microk8s and kubectl to the path during installation.
  - During the installation process, step 3 requires you to open the command prompt and input ```microk8s status --wait-ready```. If you  get the following error here ```sudo: microk8s.status: command not found. An error occurred when trying to execute 'sudo microk8s.status --wait-ready' with 'multipass': returned exit code 1``` then run the following in command prompt: ```multipass exec microk8s-vm -- sudo snap install microk8s --classic```
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2
  - The microk8s cluster is deployed with-in an Ubuntu-22.04 LTS instance running with-in WSL2
  - By default WSL enables a maximum of the 50% of the system RAM to be used (this can be changed be editing the .wslconfig file if needed)
  - **Please Note**: WSL will only work with system names (i.e. what you name your windows machine in settings) that contain lower-case charachters, numbers & hyphens.
  - To install WSL2, open up the command prompt and enter the below (you will need to restart your PC afterwards): ```wsl.exe --install```

#### Execution Platform (Windows 10/11)

Download the [powershell script](https://github.com/EannaFennell/CellMAPS/blob/main/windows-wsl/deploy.ps1) which install the execution platform and it's dependencies.

Navigate to the folder which the powershell script was downloaded to, right click on the file and select the option 'Run with powershell as Admin'. If that option isn't present find the Powershell icon in the Windows menu, right click on it and select the option Run as administrator. Navigate to the folder the powershell script has been downloaded too with command cd <path/to/folder> replacing <path/to/folder> with the actual path folder on your machine. Finally run the command ```.\deploy.ps1```. (Note: If this fails run the command ```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned``` then re-run the script using ```.\deploy.ps1```). <br />

The script will first install WSL2 (if not already installed) with an instance of Ubuntu-22.04 LTS. (If it exits and prints ```Hostname is invalid. Exiting.``` see note above about system names; Installation->Windows 10/11->Prerequisites->Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2). During the install of Ubuntu-22.04 LTS you will prompted to complete the ubuntu configuration (i.e. set username and password, etc..). Depending on your windows version this may launch in a new powerhsell window (once complete just return to the original powershell). If a new window isn't opened, once Ubuntu config is complete, enter ```CTRL+D``` to exit the Ubuntu terminal and continue with the install in powershell. The script will then configure Ubuntu so it can be used with CellMAPS, and restart WSL2. <br />

You will first be prompted to enter your DockerHub Username followed by your DockerHub Password (ensure these are correct as deployment will fail otherwise). <br />

Next the script will install microk8s. Note: By default WSL2 is deployed on the C: drive, once microk8s is installed this script will automatically move the WSL instance on the drive with the most available storage. It will then restart the cluster and install the various addons and configurations required for running the execution platform that will be deployed on the cluster. <br />

Finally the CellMAPS services will be deployed on the cluster. <br />

*The IP address for the cluster will be printed*. Please note this down as you will need to add it to the CellMAPS modelling environment so the modelling and execution environments can communicate with each other. The url to access to data-upload portal will also be printed. <br />

#### Modelling Environment (Windows 10/11)

Download the [application](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cincodebio/files/ime.win32.x86_64.zip/download) and unzip it. The modelling environment can be launched by double clicking on ```hippoflowtool.exe``` in the unzipped folder. <br />

**Note**: Windows places restrictions on the maximum path length, therefore we recommending moving the zip file to the root directory ( C:/) before unzipping it, to avoid these errors.

To finish, go to *Configure Java Virtual Machine (If Necessary)* and *Add Execution Platform IP address to IME Preferences* below.

### MacOS

#### Execution Platform (MacOS)

Download the [bash script](https://github.com/EannaFennell/CellMAPS/blob/main/macos/deploy.sh) which installs the execution platform and it's dependencies. <br />

To run the script open *Terminal* and run ```bash <path-to-script>/deploy.sh``` replacing ```<path-to-script>``` with the directory you saved the script to. <br />

You will first be prompted to enter your DockerHub Username followed by your DockerHub Password (ensure these are correct as deployment will fail otherwise). <br />

Next you will be asked the resources you wish to allocate to the execution platform; Number of CPU cores, GB of RAM and GB of Storage. <br />

The script will now check if you have Homebrew installed on your machine, if Homebrew is not installed, it will be installed for you (you may need to enter your system password as a part of the install process). <br />

Next the script will check if you have Multipass installed on your machine, if not it will be installed for you (you may need to enter your system password as a part of the install process). <br />

Next the script will install microk8s. It will deploy a VM called microk8s-vm in Mutlipass and deploy then Microk8s cluster, then wait for it to start up. Once the cluster has started, the various addons and configurations required for running the CdB execution platform will be deployed on the cluster. The cluster will then be restarted. <br />

Finally the CellMAPS services will be deployed on the cluster. <br />

*The IP address for the cluster will be printed*. Please note this down as you will need to add it to the CellMAPS modelling environment so the modelling and execution environments can communicate with each other. The url to access to data-upload portal will also be printed. <br />

#### Modelling Environment (MacOS)

Download the [application](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cincodebio/files/ime.macosx.x86_64.zip/download) and unzip it.

### Configure Java Virtual Machine (If Necessary)

The modelling environment requires Java 11 to be installed to on your machine to work. If you do not have a Java 11 already on your machine (and configured on your path) follow these instructions:

  1. Head to the [Temurin](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=11&package=jdk&os=windows&arch=any) website and select options from the dropdown for 'Architecture' to match your system (x64 for 64 bit Windows Systems).
  2. Download the JDK (.zip version), unzip it and rename the unzipped folder jre.
  3. Find the folder for the modelling environment, it should be named something like ```HippoFlowTool-1.202405081710```. Open it. 
  4. Move/Copy the extracted jre folder (from step 2) into the ```HippoFlowTool-1.202405081710``` folder. If using MacOS, move/copy the folder into the ```Eclipse``` subfolder.

### Add Execution Platform IP address to IME Preferences

In the modelling environment navigate to ```Hippoflow -> Window -> Preferences -> CincoDeBio Preferences``` in the menu.

You should see a form like the one below:

<img src="Images/IP_Input.png" align="center" alt="" width="800"/> <br/>

Next, enter in the IP address (which was displayed when the execution platform was installed. Don't included http(s)://, etc.. Only the IP address (i.e. 0.0.0.0)

Hit **Apply and Close**.

Finally hit the ```Refresh CdB SIBs``` button on the top toolbar, this will synchronise the SIB palette with the set of SIBs available on the execution platform.

## Processes

CellMAPS includes both image processing and single-cell spatial analyses (see below). An in-depth description of these capabilities are available in our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/). Here, we will give a brief description of the capabilities as well as input and output data requirements.

<img src="Images/HIPPo_MISSILe Schematic v5.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /> <br/>

### Image processing

#### De-array

To de-array tissue microarray (TMA) slides, we have developed SegArray. Upon data upload, the user will select that the input image is a TMA. SegArray will predict several segmentation masks to identify the cores in the TMA. The user can then inspect the result, select the best prediction and adjust any of the masks (in case of missing/false core predictions).

#### Equalisation

ACE (Automatic Contrast Equalisation) is a equalisation technique, developed as part of CellMAPS, that corrects images with low contrast to achieve greater signal to noise ratios for low expressing antigens or poor performing antibodies. It also helps to normalise expression profiles across different formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples.

#### Cell Segmentation & Feature Extraction

CellMAPS generates pseudo-membrane markers, combining multiple markers that the user inputs. From there, the user can select DeepCell, CellPose or CellSeg segmentation. Segmentation masks are saved and available for inspection and used downstream for feature extration. Feature-cell matrices are saved at this point and further analysis can be completed within CellMAPS or can be exported for analysis with third party packages.

### Analysis & Plotting

Downstream spatial analysis such as clustering (with PhenoGraph), neighbourhood analysis, microenvironment analysis, distance analysis and the corresponding plots can also be performed as part of CellMAPS.

## Running CellMAPS

We will run an example using the test data set supplied in the [data](https://github.com/EannaFennell/CellMAPS/tree/main/Data) folder to normalise, single-cell segment, extract features and plot the corresponding spatial expression of Pan-Cytokeratin.

### Setting up a project

We have provided a full project in the Github directory which would only need the SIB refreshing below. However, if you want to start your own workflow from scratch, follow the below fully.

After launching the Execution Platform, select ```Create a new project``` from the ```Project Explorer``` in the top left of the window and name it accordingly. Next, right click on the project and select "Create SIBs Library", making sure to name the library ```Lib.sibs```. Then on the toolbar, hit the ```Refresh Cdb SIBs``` which looks like the below.

This should result in the Lib.sibs file filling with SIBs as below.

Next, create a workflow by right clicking on the project, then ```New``` and then ```New HippoFlow```.

### Designing a workflow

Designing workflows for CellMAPS is currently done in the modelling environment which looks like the below.

<img src="Images/overview_eclipse.PNG" align="center" alt="" width="800"/> <br/>

Each box represents a process (e.g. tissue de-arraying, etc.), with inputs (in orange) and outputs (in green). To design a workflow, you must drag processes from the left hand side menu under ```myProject -> Lib.sibs``` into the worksheet. From there, you must connect the boxes together with the large arrows which can be done by hovering over the name in the box, until an arrow appears and then dragging that arrow to the name on the subsequent box. Subsequently, the inputs and outputs must be connected. For this, drag lines between the inputs and outputs which share the same name on adjacent boxes. Although lines can be drawn between any boxes, data checking will ensure only processes which can be ran sequentially are joined. Nonetheless, for ease of use, pre-designed workflows are available to use. 

### Uploading data and running a workflow

On the CellMAPS interface, select 'Data Upload' on the top.

*Image of interface*

Next, select if the slide to be analysed is a TMA or full face (FF) section and enter an experiment ID. The experiment ID has no bearing on the output, it is for you to keep track of different experiments. For example, CRC-TMA-01. 

Next, select Browse under the 'Image' field and select the tiff image to analyse. Finally for the 'Marker File' select browse and select the .txt file that stores the protein information for each stack in the corresponding tiff file (example found [here](https://github.com/EannaFennell/CellMAPS/blob/main/Data/MarkerList.txt)).

Select 'Upload' to upload all the necessary data.

Back in the Execution environment, save the current workflow. In the model validation on the bottom left, all checks must be passed. Otherwise, there is an error in the flow logic (i.e. steps are not in sequential order). Next, select "Generate code from a Graphmodel" which looks like the below.


This will result in a URL being printed in the bottom window under ```CdB Submitted Workflow Executions```. If this window isn't there, go to ```Window -> Show View -> Other``` and select ```CdB Submitted Workflow Executions```.

### Tracking progress of the workflow

To track the progress of the analysis workflow select the new URL in ```CdB Submitted Workflow Executions```. The link will take you back to the CellMAPS interface where each step of the process will be detailed and in some cases require user input.

### Expected output

For this example, the plot of the Pan-Cytokeratin spatial expression should look like the below. It should take ~30 minutes to complete on a standard desktop/laptop.
